Welcome to our High-Schools' page

<!-- This is the paragraph for the high school page -->
<p>A City is not complete without a school where teenagers can graduate 
from. In the town of Mebane, there is only one operating high school. That 
school is <a href="https://www.abss.k12.nc.us/eah" target="_blank">Eastern 
Alamance High School.</a> The school has been operating since 1962, thatâ€™s over
 50 years. The school is home to the Eagles, where the students take their pride
 seriously. You can find Friday nights to be very exciting at the football games
 that are held in the fall. The whole town comes to participate to support the 
 students in jerseys.</p>
